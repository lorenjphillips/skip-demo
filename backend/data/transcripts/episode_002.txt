welcome to the skip podcast the podcast dedicated to helping you get ahead in your Tech Career this is the second episode and in this episode I want to return to our career framework but also just answer some of the most frequently asked questions I have and coaching and meeting with hundreds of tech professionals over the years there's a set of very common questions that come up and perhaps some common pieces of advice that I give so I'm going to pull that out of the way in this episode and then we'll have a good Baseline for some of the conversations we'll take forward drill Downs into should I stay or go from different phases of company or whether we should look at compensation and how do we think about compensation and how do we think about vertical spaces and other common questions that tend to come up so this  one's really devoted to sort of the frequently asked questions in the frequently given advice that I tend to give maybe the first one is to go back to some of the things I talked about with starting fast I just want to make sure that we do think about this sort of concept of a double jump a double jump in my opinion means that we'd often look at hey I'm trying to decide whether I want to take a role and I'm trying to understand and I'm always suggesting well what is the rule set up and most people when they work in a company they  have more than one position so they work for two or three or four years and usually there's some transition and you can even see it if you look through most people's LinkedIn you'll see there are multiple paragraphs because it'll be I started in this role and then I went to the second role and sometimes it's because things weren't working out but most of the time it's because the company was growing and there was a new need and companies aren't static and in fact if they are that's probably not the best company to join and so I think the idea that you might want to think about that second job as part of this sort of decision comes up all the time so when someone's asking me about a position I'll say where can this go and usually the conversation is that people are like thinking through hey I want to make sure that I get the biggest entry role and in fact they'll look at two positions they'll say I'm looking at this growth stage company and the entry role just seems very small it feels like it's a cog in the wheel it's working for a manager that I may not be excited about and it's a position that frankly I think that I could have done a year or two ago and then this other position is so much bigger and it's so much more interesting and it's so much larger but honestly it's in a much smaller setting or it's a much weaker company I would say to them that well maybe that is the right way to go because you'll get seen and maybe there'll be a quicker path to leadership so it's not always a terrible decision but I'll say that in the first case if it turns out that you can set up the second job and that second job might be available to those that are maybe more tenured because often the best roles in a larger company are actually tenured positions meaning that they don't necessarily want people coming in who have never been at the company to hit the ground running because they know that it takes a while to have the context the language and to understand the currencies of value and just the culture itself and so what you want is to sort of say well this company has a set of tenure roles which aren't on LinkedIn or they're not available to join and then there's these other roles which are sort of Entry roles and maybe it's quite logical if I'm going to be there for three or four years that we end up looking at maybe the second role in another cell and in fact for some of these middle positions before you end up in executive roles the ideal is to get a second roll and stay for a little longer so that you can have more durable impact you can have a much stronger story so I think that this idea of a small position where the expectations are easy to exceed that immediately allow you to grow into that better and more substantive role where the story improves is really important oftentimes if you just look at it from a promotion point of view fast promotions usually are a sign of being seen you know hey I think this person is doing really well so there is a possibility that may be a slightly more Junior role that you can Crush really Gets You Through potentially a position of success and sets up that next the second area that I think is really important is length of tenure and generally potentially staying versus going I think that people end up oftentimes and I hope that you think a little very carefully that when times are tough they look to sort of the great resignation they look to sort of hey you know what I'm dissatisfied I want to move on but the problem with that is that you end up with short tenures and short tenures means you have less opportunities to show impact and so one of the concerns that I tend to flag especially in mid-career and late career is when we look at people's story what we're trying to understand is how much durability and learning did we end up having where the learning and durability tends to come from some of the version Ford version 5 if you will so for example you see this amazing person that's come in and they've launched through products and you have  another person that's come in that has basically stayed in the same team and launched and seen it through product Market fit and then they finally have gotten to a place of scale well the question is which would you value more the second person probably had a less interesting job to be honest with you because there's a point when you launch where you're not as excited about us going through all the bugs and managing all the challenges around being and a product that now has users and those users have to actually have all these you know issues you have to make all these trade-offs but frankly that's where a lot of the best learning takes place and so when you say that you've built something and really means that you built it not just you launched it and so I think that working in the early mid and late phase requires tenure and sometimes that means that you need to stay a little longer past maybe when the most interesting work is to be able to get the career value because that's when the learning takes place which then allows you to apply that to another company maybe in a different phase or perhaps you're in a leadership role and you have sort of a portfolio of early mid and late and if you've only worked in one of those phases how are you going to be able to administer how are you going to bring that playbook in so I think that the story of longer tenures whether it's staying in exactly the same role and grinding it out where some of this learning take place or actually taking a second or a third role at an existing company where you don't have to learn the culture and take almost like a 12-month Penalty Box those things matter a lot because when time is precious if you're spending all your time joining a new company building context maybe launching something then seeing the grasses Greener then doing the next then doing the next then doing the next you're just basically getting six eight months of the same movie over and over and over again versus what someone was able to do by taking it from early to late okay so jumping around is something I want us to avoid but not maybe for the reasons that people say but maybe for the reasons around learning and showing grit and durability and things that I think will help you in that leadership career okay third thing I think is one of the more interesting things that I think we've seen more than any other time when I first started in the career I think most of the tech roles and opportunities were actually classified as reasonably boring because in many ways the internet was being built in the mid 90s and boring means that there was very few apps there was no mobile phone there was very few end user experiences so my early jobs were very kind of plumbing jobs they were building the infrastructure for us to be able to enable a lot of what we see today and you see that in different areas right now you see that in AI that is just starting to become more user friendly but there's a lot of heavy lifting we saw that in crypto there's still a lot of plumbing and infrastructure so these new platforms are starting to come to Bear right now and they're going through the same level but I think that what's critical is that boring roles whether they're maybe working at a lower level of the stack or whether they're working with customers that are like businesses or maybe even businesses of businesses and some of the most interesting and successful companies tend to be ones  that you would look at those products and you don't even understand them but they're really healthy successful businesses boring roles can be very career additive and I think that the worst thing that people tend to do is they tend to only look at well I want to be in a company that has a product that I can personally use and I can be proud of we mentioned that that comes up a lot in people's career Frameworks and I'm not suggesting that that's a bad thing I think that when I worked at Credit Karma and I saw the power of the mission of helping people that were struggling with money it was a big exciting piece of the role but 99 of the day job has very little to do with that part it has a lot to do with like managing people and working through constraints and trying to scale the company and whether you're doing that for a company that's a little bit further removed from something that's your joy or whether you're doing that core and you get to be in the trenches honestly the jobs are  similar in that aspect so I sometimes think that the best career Frameworks tend to take that off the list tend to be that look I'm more agnostic to the type of company I'm going to work for in terms of the product and I'm more trying to make sure that the work I do is creative the culture the people the values the speed in which I've seen that matters a lot more I'll tell you that mission-based companies don't mean that the company is incredibly well run and the values all the way extend to how they treat their employees that's not to say that the company themselves that are very Mission driven have bad values but there's no connection there's plenty of examples on the news and the headlines of companies that seem to have these amazing missions that ultimately struggle with their culture and by the way vice versa companies that don't necessarily have the most interesting mission-driven products can be delightful amazing companies to work for and so I think that be loosely held on the products be tightly held on the way your co-workers interact and the pace of work and some of the other things that we've brought to bear on this this last piece of advice it can be challenging to absorb because it means that well I'm devoting a big chunk of my life to these products and these companies and yet at the end of the day I would hate to be in a position where I don't necessarily get to satisfy my interest as a human to make the planet better or to make other people's lives more valuable and I think that yes it might be career additive to pick a company that may not be doing maybe the most mission-based work or maybe the most interesting were but I feel like it's a selfish Act and that's a fair criticism and so what I come back with is I sort of ask people and I would ask you to think about well why is it that your work and your professional life is synonymous why isn't it the case that you might look at the job you have as one element of your professional life the best part of technology is that you're not stuck in doing one sole occupation and job and role you have an opportunity to pursue things that are adjacent to your day job as a way to diversify your experience and skills so in many ways work can only teach you so much a great piece of advice that I've received is that doing things like writing or helping companies on the side or people on the side is a great way to scratch those itches so what I've started to realize is that well let me rethink things maybe the job I want to take or the job that I have now is a part of my professional life what are the other things that I might be able to add that can really be helpful and obviously those might be things that Drive Mission those might be advisory roles for example or volunteer work where you end up saying look I really want to make sure that my career is important because the more and effective my career is the more I can invest in other parts of my life that matter and maybe with less and less constraint and more intentionality but I need to be successful to do that I just can't do that on day one but what I want to be able to do is make sure that I'm always keeping some balance but that may not be just forcing my company to be different than it is based on their constraints or finding the company that may be subpar in terms of career at the growth but is perhaps really perfect for where you want to sit on day one I would just say that well find those advisory roles that Drive Mission find something that keeps you updated on expertise that either you've had in the past and that you want to retain or that you perhaps want to acquire so for example if you've worked in let's say fintech maybe you continue to advise companies though you've bounced to another sector to grow your career maybe you want to diversify your compensation and so sometimes these advisory or Other Side Opportunities might give equity and you now have a few different ways of investing your time and sure one might be your primary but you might have other ways that could actually lead to some value and lastly maybe it's just an area of Interest maybe you just foundationally carer about another space that you just don't have the opportunity to invest for your time but it's something that you're really excited about oh this is something that might appear in five to ten years and I like to just get smarter if you're effective professional there's always need for talent and with remote work and zoom there's opportunities to get engaged in lots of ways and so we'll spend a little bit more time on this over the course of this podcast to sort of put some structure around how do you find these roles and how do you help connect to people that most need you but just keep in mind that being tightly held on professional life and work and being all about being the same puts more pressure on work and more pressure on you you want to release that you want to be loosely held in that and in some ways I almost feel like two to three hours a month you know that's all I'm asking where you just pull a little bit of time off and make sure that you're investing in something that is valuable professionally but maybe adjacent to your work being more intentional about  finding those Avenues spending a little bit less time just going to conferences per se because I think people are like oh I want to be career additives I'm just going to go to conferences I personally don't find a lot of value on conferences because they tend to be too generic I'd almost rather find smaller opportunities where I could have one-on-one conversations or meet with Founders meet with potential other employees meet with your friends and find out what they really work on and see if you can understand and help them those things tend to be more connected they tend to be more creative because then you get a little a bit more depth and durability and opportunities to invest over time so anyway I think that these sort of opportunities end up pulling you forward and creating luck part of the backdrop here relates to the people that you end up connecting with I mentioned that when you do these Side Opportunities those Side Opportunities sometimes give you opportunities of learning and learning oftentimes from the people you run into and I think that another part of our  framework and another part of how we think about jobs is a little bit softer but it's just the people that you interact with what I find is that companies and positions tend to have a some barometer on how social are those roles and what I've noticed is that the people that tend to have luck in their careers tend to know a lot of individuals and they might be known oh you know I I how did you find the current job that you're in there's a person I worked for in the past and they started a company the next thing I know they called me I was at a point in time when it made sense and I took a risk it's like well that's amazing I worked out it sounds like how do you think about it when you look back it's like yeah it's just like a lucky break you know I just happen to know this person and we got to know each other and they saw some of the work and then they decided to do something amazing and I happen to be a call I think they could have hired anyone but so that was a known quantity it just worked out and then you think a little bit about it and when you're like well maybe you can be intentional about that in your current job maybe today what you can do is think about the people who you work with who might be the person that's going to create that break for you do you have a relationship with that individual have you been spending enough time maybe there's two to three hours I mentioned earlier should be spent just making sure that you are known or the people that are around you I think that the flip side of that is maybe there are some roles where that's not possible you know a lot of folks that are starting their career are actually voting to find more in-person work and they're worried about this Zoom remote situation and I think there's some fear that this next Generation might be more isolated and they don't get a chance to be in the office I'm sure there's a lot of skills you learn by being in rooms but there's a lot of luck that gets created by knowing people and it's hard to know people when you're scheduled all the time because a lot of the knowledge is that bumping in going to drinks after work or just sort of being in a meeting and saying hey I really appreciated what you said there I'd love to get a little bit of more time and really understand and by the way this works both ways you might be the person that makes that call you might be the person who needs to go and grow a new team and the ones you knew from the past are obviously the first calls you make and so I think that roles themselves have almost like a social index associated with it some companies are more conversational interactive and more socially connected some positions tend to have that some cultures tend to lean towards that but make sure that you're connected with the people that are around you particularly those that you think are talented not for the pure purpose of networking but for the idea of learning and engaging and helping one another is incredibly career additive I really want to make sure that we put that in as a factor even as you look at new roles but most importantly just even something you can do even tomorrow you can make that list and start working on it's not a lot of time and I know that it sort of favors the extrovert But ultimately even if you were to do it in a really quiet one-on-one fashion I think that you'll find that it'll be some of the most fun you'll have then solving the day-to-day job and it was not a lot of time so something to consider the last thing I would say sticks with this sort of notion around companies and talent and I think that what we sometimes don't quite think through is that companies tend to self-select a band of talent and it is not the case that the highest most successful companies always have the highest most successful band of talent and that vice versa the weakest companies have selected the weakest band of talent actually I think that there's only a loose coupling between this because there's so much luck in determining what success looks like that you might have companies that had average talent but have just done exceptionally well because they found the right recipe and then one thing led to another and sometimes companies shift their talent as they became more successful they end up getting maybe higher quality Talent or as they became more successful and perhaps a bit more at scale they lost some of their best people so there's a talent band that exists in every company of sort of like who is the type of person that is coming in and I think you want to have a bit of a nose for that and then you want to have a bit of a realistic sense of where you may fit it so the key challenge is that let's say you're a high performer now you have to think a little bit about well if I'm going to be in the next company and if I in the interview process or I look at the backgrounds of  the people that I'll be working with I find myself significantly below where they'll end up being now that might be amazing for you that's what happened in my first startup in my first startup I came out of college I had no work experience and the people that I joined all of them were at the top of their career they were all almost legendary in status but there was only seven of us and so in some ways I was like wow this is an incredible talent pool and the challenge that I'll face is I gotta keep up I got to make sure that I'm able to hit that same town I gotta find my Niche because the bar is pretty high around here well at that stage in my career I had very little lose but I had a decision to make between doing that and joining a small but incredibly High talented organization or going to a much larger company at the time it was on Microsystems where I would be in the middle of the pack on day one and there are some people there that had been there for a long time that frankly weren't particularly excited about being at work and then there were some people that were also incredibly legendary and being in the middle of the pack might have been fine because I would have found my way and found flow quicker but at the time I thought well you know what this is the time to bet on myself I'm just going to see if I can skip up and what I found was that there were areas in a seven person company that weren't just getting done that these legendary folks didn't have the time or perhaps even the skill deal to go invest in and so I go and did all those things and one thing led to another and I got seen and that was really really career additive so think a little bit about well what would you do if you were ahead and boy being at the pulled forward from a town level is just as important as being pulled forward from a growth lover now the reverse can also be career additive sometimes being one of the better people in an organization is the fastest way to be seen so let's take an example of a company that has historically hired only who they get and in those cases the company was perhaps bootstrapped for cash or they had pre-product Market fit and so the people that they brought in were kind of average or below average because they weren't able to pay them much and they weren't known and then the next thing you know the company ended up succeeding and now they call you and they're like look we need you to come in and then you start talking to them and they're like wow these folks have not been particularly successful in their careers and they might be good people they might have great careers Downstream but they're not quite where you're at is this a job not to take people call me all the time and say yeah I was very impressed with that company I said well the company itself from a growth point of view and from a culture point of view and from what they've achieved is pretty remarkable what position are they offering oh they're going to make me one of the leaders there okay well being a leader of a company that's pretty successful where you're asked to sort of look at the talent and look at the opportunity and bring your expertise in can be great you know you're not going to get that in a cog in the wheel roll if you're a  small thing and a big company you're going to get lost sure it's maybe better for your brand but maybe this is a chance for you to lead from that front and the next thing you know the story you tell is going to be amazing so why don't we consider that and I think that people tend to feel that oh I'm a Harvard Stanford why would I go to the state school and I'm like look sometimes it's not a matter of brand and getting an a it's a matter of being seen getting to flow and getting to growth and so what I'm realizing is that be loosely held on things like the band and make sure it might be career additive and ultimately it's this tight versus loosely held belief that I think is important to evaluate where are you tightly held where you loosely held and are they absolutely right for this stage of career thank you  foreign [Music] conclusion I just want to walk through some of these questions that we've had a chance to answer I think the first one is consider these double jump idea that the best roles in companies aren't always available to new outside folks if that's the case then find those second Rules by being a little longer in the company and by calculating where you can find flow fastest second these longer tenures can be helpful because they teach the right lessons and some of those lessons are grid and seeing products and efforts all the way through that learning is essential boring is just not a bug boring might be a huge feature to your career because they are sometimes the most career additive companies because of the values the people they attract and the kind of businesses that they create and frankly perhaps the best compensation rules too so just be very loosely held on product and the excitement that you might find because 99 of the job is probably unconnected to that piece of the role professional life shouldn't be just your day job and ensure you have a few hours that you're spending every month to advance interests even if it is you work at quote unquote the boring company and you have this exciting opportunity to do things on the side that's great great find professional diversity in some ways and in fact a slightly lower paced job which lets you explore those Pursuits might be far better in the long meet the people that you're working with especially the ones that you find connect with you and maybe have great talent or that are up and comers because that creates luck down the road either opportunities for you to join and pull forward or networking opportunities for you to hire Downstream it's only a good thing when you can connect with folks and get to know them I learn more from that that I did actually the day job and lastly think about the talent ban that the company that you're considering or they're at today and where you fit amongst them because being intentional is very helpful because either it's a path to be seen or it's a path to be pulled forward but just be very thoughtful about where that Talent ban fits it now I hope that you've enjoyed this last two episodes on Career Frameworks and career questions I really look forward to more of these because I think this is the bread and butter of this podcast is how to unsure this conversation around career skipping forward and the advice that we're talking through continues to be a mainstream part of the discussion that we have here in this podcast I would love to get questions from you so so any questions that you have please submit them thanks for listening I hope you enjoyed these conversations on compensation I can't wait to hear your questions bye [Music]
